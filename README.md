COMPILER-LAB

PROGRAMS:
1. Design and implement a lexical analyzer using c language to recognize all valid tokens in the input program .it should ignore redundant spaces,tabs,newlines and comments.
2. Write a c program to implement first of a grammar.
3. Write a c program to implement follow of a grammar.
4. Write a c program to implement first and follow of a grammar.
5. Design and implement a recursive descent parser for a given grammar.
6. Construct a shift reduce parser for a given language.
7. Write a program to perform constant propagation.
8. Implement backend of a compiler using c.
9. Implement intermediate code generation for simple expressions.
10. To design and implement a lexical analyzer using lex tool that can recognize various tokens.
11. To design and implement a lex program that count the number of lines,words,spaces,and characters in the given input.
12. To design and implement a lex program that scans the given input string and convert 'abc' to 'ABC'.
13. To write a lex program that reads a string and counts the number of vowels and consonants.
14. To design and implement a simple calculator using lex that can perform basic arithemetic operations such as addition,substraction,division,multiplication.
15. To design and implement a lex and yacc program to check whether a given string is valid identifier or not.
16. To design and implement a program using  lex and yacc tools for validating and evaluating arithemetic expression.
