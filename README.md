#COMPILER-LAB

PROGRAMS:
1. FIRST OF A GRAMMAR : FIRST of a symbol (usually a non-terminal) tells us what terminal symbols can appear at the beginning of strings derived from that symbol.
2. FOLLOW OF A GRAMMAR : FOLLOW of a non-terminal tells us what terminal symbols can come right after it in some valid sentence of the grammar.
