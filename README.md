COMPILER-LAB

PROGRAMS:
1. FIRST OF A GRAMMAR : FIRST of a symbol (usually a non-terminal) tells us what terminal symbols can appear at the beginning of strings derived from that symbol.
2. FOLLOW OF A GRAMMAR : FOLLOW of a non-terminal tells us what terminal symbols can come right after it in some valid sentence of the grammar.
3. LEXICAL ANALYZER  : Converts source code characters into a sequence of meaningful tokens.
4. FIRST AND FOLLOW
5. RECURSIVE DESCENT PARSER :  A top-down parser built from a set of mutually recursive functions, one for each grammar rule.
6. SHIFT REDUCE PARSER : A bottom-up parser that shifts input onto a stack and reduces it to grammar rules until the start symbol is derived.
7. CONSTANT PROPAGATION : An optimization that replaces variables with known constant values to simplify code.
8. TARGET CODE GENERATION : Final compiler phase that produces machine code or assembly code for the target architecture.
9. INTERMEDIATE CODE GENERATION : Produces an abstract, machine-independent representation of the source program (e.g., three-address code).
